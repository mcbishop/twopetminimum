"Two cats are good, three even better..." 
Want to adopt a pair of cats?

My app uses the Petfinder API to identify siblings and bonded pairs of cats, and only show these pairs.

The Petfinder website lists adoptable pets from an assortment of shelters and rescue groups. With Petfinder, you can filter on characteristics like pet breed, age or length of fur, but there's one missing filter: bonded pairs (which are often required to be adopted together). So I built my app to do that.

I also suggest similar cat pairs based on the listing currently viewed, and allow users to text a listing to their phone using Twilio's API. 


Tech stack: Python, JavaScript, AJAX, Flask, Postgres, SQLAlchemy
APIs: Petfinder, Twilio, Google Maps
