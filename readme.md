"Two cats are good, three even better..." 
Want to adopt a pair of cats?

Two Cat Minimum uses PetFinder's API. 

Petfinder lists adoptable pets from an assortment of shelters and rescue groups. With Petfinder, you can filter on characteristics like pet breed, age or length of fur, but there's one missing feature: bonded pairs. Shelters often require bonded pairs to be adopted together. Some even require that kittens under 6 months be adopted in pairs. 

PetFinder's user interface doesn't allow to filter for bonded pairs or siblings (hence me building my own site!).  My app analyzes these listings to identify siblings and bonded pairs of cats, and only show these pairs.
